      :: New! Support for Linux! Thanks to Leledumbo! 

           by Leledumbo for Linux users:
              1. Build all libraries in the  ./dummylibs
              2. Put it somewhere ldconfig can find (or just run ldconfig with their directories as arguments)

                "The idea of this is just to make the package installable in the [Lazarus for Linux] IDE,
                  applications will still use the android version of the libraries."
